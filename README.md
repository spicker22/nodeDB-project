# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




Main Idea
-	My idea -> an online directory for doctors
-	Description -> 1 page of multiple cards that have details for each doctorâ€™s office 

Main Components(files)
-	Homepage -> has different cards with doctor details
-	Add button on homepage -> adds a new card to the homepage
-	Edit button -> each card will have a edit button to then edit the card
-	Delete button -> each card will have a delete button to then edit the card
-	Save button -> each will have save button
